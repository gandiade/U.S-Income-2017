# U.S-Income-2017
This is a graduated circle map depicting average household income in the United States in the year 2017. The data comes from 
the United States Census Bureau. I chose a darker green for my circles to make them stand out on the basemap. For the basemap I chose a light gray and white shade so that the information on the map could pop out. When you hover over a circle, a blue outline appears. When you click a circle a popup apprears that included the name or each state and the income amount.
